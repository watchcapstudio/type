# Changelog

All notable changes to **type** are listed here, newest first. Each release
section becomes the body of the matching GitHub Release, which the in-app
auto-updater and kellyvohs.com/type both read from.

## v1.11.3

### Fixed
- **Highlighting with the mouse is under control again.** On the editable page, dragging to select a few lines could run away: the page scrolled out from under the pointer and the highlight raced to the end of the note. Selection now follows the mouse and stops where you stop. Typing is unchanged, and the writing line still holds its place at the middle of the page.

---

## v1.11.2

### Fixed
- **⌘⌫ clears to the start of the line.** Holding Command and pressing Delete now works the way it does everywhere else on the Mac — it removes everything from the cursor back to the beginning of the line and leaves anything to the right of the cursor alone. Before, it wiped the whole line no matter where the cursor sat; on the editable page it did nothing at all.

---

## v1.11.1

### Fixed
- **Back from kept, ready to type.** Pressing Esc to leave the kept browser now drops you back on the page with the cursor already blinking — just start writing, no click needed first.

---

## v1.11.0

### Changed
- **Even spacing, top to bottom.** The line you're writing now breathes exactly like every line above it. No more tightening on the current line, and no little jump when you press Return — your spacing choice (tight / normal / loose / wide) applies to the whole sheet, uniformly. The cursor stays small, sized to the letters rather than the spacing, at every setting. (Under the hood: type now paints its own cursor, the way a native editor does, instead of taking the browser's — which is glued to the line height.)

### Fixed
- **The editable page opens every time.** With the editable page turned on, skipping the opening animation could leave you on a locked sheet you couldn't change. Now editable is editable no matter how you get to the page.
- **The editable page keeps your cursor where you're writing.** On Mac the writing line now rests at the middle of the page — the same height as the typewriter page — and the text scrolls up beneath it as you go, instead of drifting down toward the bottom.

---

## v1.10.0

### New
- **iCloud sync, on by default.** Your writing saves to a “type” folder in iCloud Drive and syncs across your devices — privately. type has no server, so your pages are never seen by anyone but you. On first launch you choose: sync with iCloud, or pick your own folder (an Obsidian vault, Dropbox, anywhere). A single iCloud-sync switch lets you save somewhere else for a while and return to your type folder in one tap.
- **Settings, as a side rail.** Opening settings now slides the page aside to reveal a full-height panel, the way the iPhone app does. Everything’s grouped — Saving, Writing, Display, Sound — with theme and line spacing pinned at the bottom.
- **Browse your kept pages.** A quiet **kept** sits between KEEP and BURN (or press ⌘⇧K): it opens everything you’ve saved as a roll of paper sheets you can scroll, arrow through, and open to read.
- **A cleaner bottom bar.** KEEP · KEPT · BURN are plain words now; hover any of them for its shortcut. Settings moved to a small menu in the top-right corner, and share to the top-left.

### Changed
- Themes are **day / night / amber / dispatch**; line spacing is **tight / normal / loose / wide**.

---

## v1.9.0

### New
- **Undo, redo, and real selection.** The writing line is now built on macOS's own text engine, so ⌘Z undoes, ⌘⇧Z redoes, and you can select, copy, and paste like in any native field — dictation works too. The typewriter feel is unchanged: committed lines still lock, and the block cursor still rides the strike line. But the text underneath is solid now, so the occasional doubled cursor and dropped/scrambled characters are gone.
- **Line spacing.** A new tight / normal / air control in settings sets how much room each line gets — a dense draft or a wide, airy page.
- **Autocorrect.** A settings toggle, off by default so the typewriter stays literal. Turn it on to let macOS fix spelling as you write.
- **Your kept pages, in the app.** The review drawer reads the real `.md` files in your save folder, so you can browse, search, and reopen what you've written. Share a kept page to the system share sheet, or click the folder name in settings to open it in Finder.

---

## v1.8.0

### New
- **⌘⇧B — report with a screenshot.** The same shortcut the Dispatch work board uses: it captures the page exactly as it looks (just the window, no screen-recording permission), opens the feedback sheet with the shot attached, and the report lands with the screenshot included. Plain ⌘B still burns — the shift makes all the difference.

---

## v1.7.0

### New
- **Paste works.** ⌘V types the clipboard onto the page. On the writing line it flows through the same wrap as typing, so a long passage lands exactly as if you'd typed it — including line breaks. With the cursor up on an earlier line (editable page on), it pastes right at the cursor; the line still stops at the margin. On a locked page, the past stays locked — paste up there takes no ink, just like typing. Pasted text keeps its spacing as written: the double-space-makes-a-period trick only applies to your own keystrokes.
- **Real text-navigation shortcuts when you arrow up.** Once the cursor is on an earlier line — editable page on or off — the macOS habits work: ⌥← / ⌥→ jump by word, ⌘← / ⌘→ (or Home / End) go to the ends of the line, ⌘↑ jumps to the first line, and ⌘↓ drops you straight back to the writing line.

---

## v1.6.0

### New
- **Editable page.** A new switch in settings unlocks the page: the arrow keys move the cursor back through everything you've written, and you can edit it like a normal document — insert, delete, fix the typo three lines up. The paper rolls back down so the line you're editing sits right at the strike point. It's a decision you make before you write: once there's ink on the page the switch dims and stays put until the next sheet, so you can't bail out of a locked page halfway through. Off by default — the typewriter is still the typewriter.

---

## v1.5.2

### Fixed
- **Choosing a save folder works again with Stay on top on.** With "Stay on top" enabled, clicking **choose…** under "save as .md to" appeared to do nothing — the folder picker was opening *behind* the always-on-top window, hidden from view. The picker now attaches to the window itself, so it always comes up in front no matter what.

---

## v1.5.1

### Improved
- **Updates show a progress bar instead of a stack of dialogs.** When a new version is downloading, a quiet bar at the top of the page fills as it goes, so you can actually see how far along it is — no more clicking "Check for Updates" again to find out. When it's ready, a single **restart** appears: one click installs it and reopens right where you left off. Checking from the menu gives instant feedback too. And if you'd rather not stop, just ignore it — the update still installs on its own the next time you quit.

---

## v1.5.0

### Improved
- **Markdown lines read like the real thing.** A line that starts with `> `, `- ` / `* `, or `# ` now hides the literal marker as you write — a quote shows just its left rule, a list item gets a real • bullet, a heading simply goes bold. The markers still live in the file underneath, so your saved `.md` stays valid and byte-faithful; they're only tucked out of sight on screen. Wrapped list and heading lines keep their shape through resize and reload.
- **The pointer gets out of your way.** The mouse cursor now hides itself while you're typing, so it stops hovering in the middle of the page when you tab back from another app. Any nudge of the mouse brings it right back.

### Fixed
- **Editing a list, quote, or heading line from above works again.** Pressing ↑ to step back onto an earlier line and type over it used to break on any `- `, `> `, or `# ` line: the cursor landed on the now-hidden marker, became invisible, and keystrokes piled up on top of themselves — sometimes quietly mangling the line. The cursor now skips past the marker to the first real character, stays visible, and leaves the marker untouched.

---

## v1.4.2

### Fixed
- **Keeping a long page rolls it up, not down.** On a page taller than the window, ⌘S used to shove the sheet *downward* a moment before it vanished, instead of pulling it up and off the platen. The eject now lifts from wherever the page is scrolled to, so a kept page always rolls up and away like paper leaving a typewriter — and the date stamp lands on the clean platen behind it. Short pages behave exactly as before.

---

## v1.4.1

### Improved
- **Launch feels intentional.** The window now stays hidden until first paint is ready, then appears with the "type." wordmark animation running from the top. No more white flash, no more catching the intro mid-animation — the window opening *is* the wordmark reveal.
- **Window dragging in small sizes.** Added an invisible drag region along the top of the window so you can always grab and move it, even at narrow widths where there's no chrome to grab onto.

### Fixed
- **No more mid-word splits on resize.** A word like "how" used to occasionally render as "ho / w" when the window was sized just-so. The CSS now only breaks mid-word as a last resort, and the column math has a touch more headroom so the JS-wrapped lines reliably fit the visual container.
- **Seeded opening quotes re-center on resize.** Previously only your own typing reflowed when you resized the window; the quote on launch stayed at its original wrap, drifting left when the window grew. The quote now reflows with you, preserving body / attribution styling.

---

## v1.4.0

### New
- **Markdown styling.** Lines starting with `> `, `- ` / `* `, or `# ` get gentle visual treatment — italic block quotes with a left rule, hanging-indent bullets, bolder headings. Strictly line-level: `**bold**` and `_italic_` inside a line don't render, so the typewriter grid stays intact and your `.md` export is byte-identical to what you typed.
- **Pages counter.** New toggle in settings alongside word count and timer. 250 words per page — the manuscript / morning-pages convention.

### Improved
- **Resize keeps the page centered.** When you stretch the window, committed lines re-wrap to the new width so your writing stays centered instead of stranded against the left edge. Blank-line paragraph breaks are preserved.
- **Save animation.** The page now pulls off the platen with a "pull then rip" curve — gentle engagement, then a fast finish. The date stamp lands on a clean empty platen instead of fading in over the lifting page.
- **Burn animation.** Smoke puffs removed. Characters fade in place (no per-char jitter). Sparks redesigned to feel like real campfire embers — fire-orange across every theme, glide along curved paths instead of going straight, spawn from across the burning text, with a couple of lingerers that hang on after the rest fade.

### Fixed
- `⌥⌫` (delete previous word) now keeps the space before the deleted word. It used to eat the space too.
